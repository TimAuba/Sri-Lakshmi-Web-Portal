# Sri-Lakshmi-Web-Portal
Sri Lakshmi Super Market is an independent Asian grocery store located in the heart of Western Sydney, catering for thousands of households with their day-to-day grocery needs such as vegetables, fruits, frozen packed food and hot food. We also maintain a large warehouse to replenish our stock every day to minimise customer disruption. We provide the best customer service and experience for all walk-in customers and entice them to revisit with our facility to avail incredible offers changing every week. 
Due to the high demand for groceries and hot food and bustling schedules of our customers, which limits their time to shop in store, Sri Lakshmi decided to expand business operations by building an online portal and providing home delivery
